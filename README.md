## Introduction to Graphs

Graphs are fundamental data structures in computer science that model relationships between entities. This section introduces the basic concepts of graphs, including vertices, edges, and different types of graphs (directed, undirected, weighted, etc.).

## Graph Representation

Understanding how to represent graphs in code is crucial. This section covers various graph representation techniques, such as adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and their applications.

## Graph Traversal

Graph traversal involves visiting all vertices and edges in a graph systematically. Learn about popular traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) and their applications.

## Graph Algorithms

Explore a variety of graph algorithms that solve common problems, including shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), minimum spanning tree algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's), and more.

## Advanced Graph Topics

Dive into advanced graph topics, such as network flows, bipartite graphs, topological sorting, and applications of graphs in real-world scenarios.

Happy graph mastering!
